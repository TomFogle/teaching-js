To best understand a shortcut/command, try it out for yourself. Our descriptions help, but nothing beats hands-on practice. It will help you visualize the explanations, which is crucial for learning in general, but especially in code.

⌘ = Command
⇧ = Shift
⌥ = Option
⌃ = Control
←↑↓→ = Arrow keys
– – – – – – – – –

Note:
key1 + key2 means hold down key1, then press key2. For example, ⌘ + TAB means hold down ⌘, then press TAB while still holding ⌘.

If there are more than two keys, hold down key1, then also hold down key2, then press key 3. For example, ⌘ + ⇧ + TAB means hold down ⌘, then also hold down ⇧, then press TAB while still holding ⌘ and ⇧.

The Basics – necessities to not go crazy while using a computer

– The cursor is the blinking vertical line that shows where you are about to type. 
– Click to move the cursor.
– Click and drag to highlight text.

⌘ + ⇧ + Z = Redo the thing you undid

Switch – switch between tabs, programs, windows
– – – – – – – – –
⌘ + TAB
– – – – – – – – –
Switch to your most recently used program (Firefox, Sublime, etc).

If you use ⌘ + TAB and let go of TAB (keep holding ⌘), you will see a menu of all your open programs. You can continue to cycle through open programs by hitting TAB. Let go of TAB to switch to the highlighted program. 

If the program menu is open, use ⇧ + TAB to cycle the other direction. To open this menu and cycle in other direction from the get-go, use ⌘ + ⇧ + TAB.

⌃ + TAB

Just like ⌘ + TAB except it cycles through tabs in your browser (and some code editors). 

Unlike Firefox, Chrome does not come with this function. You can go to

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-last-tab/naolnccddjabbhmjogiejjgocjnglmge?hl=en

and add the extension to your browser. You can then use ⌥ + Q to toggle between the 2 most recent tabs, though its limited functionality ends there. If you want the same experience as with ⌘ + TAB, I recommend using Firefox.

⌘ + ~
– – – – – – – – –
Switch between windows within a program. 

For example, if you have multiple Firefox windows open (not talking about tabs) or multiple Word documents open, you can switch between them this way. As usual, ⌘ + ⇧ + ~ cycles backwards.

⇧ + arrow keys 
– – – – – – – – –
In general, ⇧ selects things. You can combine ⇧ with other keys to select all text between where the cursor was to where the cursor moved. 

⇧ + ↑ = Does what the ↑ arrow key does, plus selects all text along the way.
⇧ + ↓ = Does what the ↓ arrow key does, plus selects all text along the way.
⇧ + ← = Does what the ← arrow key does, plus selects characters along the way.
⇧ + → = Does what the → arrow key does, plus selects characters along the way.

Quick Select – select lines and large chunks of text
– – – – – – – – –
You can combine functionalities of multiple shortcuts at once by understanding the general purpose of different keys.

For example, if you were at the start of a line, to select the whole line you can use ⌘ + ⇧ + →. The ⌘ will jump you to the end and ⇧ will select everything along the way. If you were somewhere in the middle of the line, you would grab everything from there up to the end.

⌘ + ⇧ + → = select from cursor to end of line.
⌘ + ⇧ + ← = select from cursor to beginning of line.
