Welcome!

This is a guide to keyboard shortcuts that will save you a ton of time/energy while coding and using your computer in general. 

We also cover shortcuts for Sublime Text, the free text editor we recommend you use to write code.

Don’t understand a shortcut/command? Try it out for yourself! Our descriptions help, but nothing beats hands-on practice. It will help you visualize the explanations, which is crucial for learning in general, but especially in code.

## Symbols
These symbols represent specific keys on your keyboard 
– – – – – – – – –
⌘ = Command
⇧ = Shift
⌥ = Option
⌃ = Control
←↑↓→ = Arrow keys
DEL = delete key
TAB = tab key
– – – – – – – – –
Note:
key1 + key2 means hold down key1, then press key2. For example, ⌘ + TAB means hold down ⌘, then press TAB while still holding ⌘.

If there are more than two keys, hold down key1, then also hold down key2, then press key 3. For example, ⌘ + ⇧ + TAB means hold down ⌘, then also hold down ⇧, then press TAB while still holding ⌘ and ⇧.




## The Basics
Necessities to not go crazy while using a computer

– The cursor is the blinking vertical line that shows where you are about to type. 
– Click to move the cursor.
– Click and drag to highlight text.

– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
⌘ + S = Save a file
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
⌘ + Z = Undo the last thing you typed or deleted
⌘ + ⇧ + Z = Redo the thing you undid
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
⌘ + C = Copy highlighted text
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
⌘ + X = Copy and delete highlighted text (cut)
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
⌘ + V = Paste the text you copied
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
⌘ + A = Select all text
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
⌘ + R = Refresh page in browser
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
⌘ + Q = Quit current application
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –




## Spotlight 
Search for programs and files quickly
– – – – – – – – –
This is a real life-saver. It’s often much easier to open programs this way than through Finder or the dock at the bottom of the screen. Simply bring up Spotlight, start typing until it suggests the file or program you want to open, and hit enter/return.

– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
⌘ + space = open Spotlight
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –

For some unfortunate few, this Spotlight shortcut may not work. Fortunately, there’s an easy fix. Go to the apple symbol at the top-left of your screen.

Apple > System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Spotlight > Show Spotlight Search

Check the “Show Spotlight Search” box.




## Browser Shortcuts 
 New tab, close tab, reopen tab in browser
– – – – – – – – –
Browser lingo recap: A window has tabs in the similarly to how a binder has tabs.

⌘ + T = open a new tab
⌘ + W = close current tab
⌘ + ⇧ + T = reopen last closed tab

⌘ + N = open a new window
⌘ + ⇧ + W = close current window
⌘ + ⇧ + N = reopen last closed tab




## Switch  
Switch between tabs, programs, windows
– – – – – – – – –
⌘ + TAB
– – – – – – – – –
Switch to your most recently used program (Firefox, Sublime, etc).

If you use ⌘ + TABand let go of TAB (keep holding ⌘), you will see a menu of all your open programs. You can continue to cycle through open programs by hitting TAB. Let go of TAB to switch to the highlighted program. 

If the program menu is open, use ⇧ + TAB to cycle the other direction. To open this menu and cycle in other direction from the get-go, use ⌘ + ⇧ + TAB.

– – – – – – – – –
⌃ + TAB
– – – – – – – – –
Just like ⌘ + TAB except it cycles through tabs in your browser (and some code editors). 

Unlike Firefox, Chrome does not come with this function. You can go to

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-last-tab/naolnccddjabbhmjogiejjgocjnglmge?hl=en

and add the extension to your browser. You can then use ⌥ + Q to toggle between the 2 most recent tabs, though its limited functionality ends there. If you want the same experience as with ⌘ + TAB, I recommend using Firefox.

– – – – – – – – –
⌘ + ~ = Switch between windows within a program. 
– – – – – – – – –

For example, if you have multiple Firefox windows open (not talking about tabs) or multiple Word documents open, you can switch between them this way. As usual, ⌘ + ⇧ + ~ cycles backwards.




## Move 
Move cursor within a file
– – – – – – – – –
⌘ + arrow keys 
– – – – – – – – –
⌘ + ↑ = Go to beginning of file (Top of document, beginning of first line)
⌘ + ↓ = Go to end of file, also known as EOF (Bottom of document, end of last line)
⌘ + ← = Go to beginning of current line
⌘ + → = Go to end of current line




## Highlight 
Select small portions of text
– – – – – – – – –
⇧ + arrow keys 
– – – – – – – – –
In general, ⇧ selects things. You can combine ⇧ with other keys to select all text between where the cursor was to where the cursor moved. 

⇧ + ↑ = Does what the ↑ arrow key does, plus selects all text along the way.
⇧ + ↓ = Does what the ↓ arrow key does, plus selects all text along the way.
⇧ + ← = Does what the ← arrow key does, plus selects characters along the way.
⇧ + → = Does what the → arrow key does, plus selects characters along the way.




## Quick Select 
Select entire lines and large chunks of text
– – – – – – – – –
You can combine functionalities of multiple shortcuts at once by understanding the general purpose of different keys.

For example, if you were at the start of a line, to select the whole line you can use ⌘ + ⇧ + →. The ⌘ will jump you to the end and ⇧ will select everything along the way. If you were somewhere in the middle of the line, you would grab everything from there up to the end.

⌘ + ⇧ + → = select from cursor to end of line.
⌘ + ⇧ + ← = select from cursor to beginning of line.

Similarly, we can use ⌘ and ⇧ together with ↑ or ↓.

⌘ + ⇧ + ↑ = select from cursor to beginning of file.
⌘ + ⇧ + ↓ = select from cursor to end of file.

One common use of ⇧ + ↑ and ⇧ + ↓  is to delete paragraphs. Press ⇧ and then ↑ or ↓ a few times to grab a lot of lines quickly, then zap ‘em away with DEL.




## Quick Delete 
Delete entire words and entire lines 
– – – – – – – – –
In general, ⌥ tends to affect whole words and ⌘ tends to affect whole lines.

⌥ + DEL = delete a whole word instead of a single character
⌘ + DEL = delete everything from cursor to beginning of line

Usually people use ⌘ + DEL when they want to delete a whole line by doing ⌘ + → to go to the end of the line, then ⌘ + DEL to delete the whole thing.

Note: 
All previous shortcuts/commands (minus browser shortcuts) also work in Sublime. The following shortcuts are specific to Sublime and may not work in other programs. Some commands will not work in Sublime unless you save your work as a code file (.js, .html, etc.)




## Copy/Paste 
Copy, cut and paste with additional Sublime functionalities
– – – – – – – – –
⌘ + C = Copies text
⌘ + X = Cuts (copies+deletes) highlighted text or whole line if no text is selected
⌘ + V = Paste text
⌘ + ⇧ + V = Paste text with proper indents




## Tabs
Tab lines over while typing anywhere in line
– – – – – – – – –
TAB = indent line if cursor is at the beginning of the line
⇧ + TAB = un-indent line if cursor is at the beginning of the line

⌘ + ] = indent current line
⌘ + [ = un-indent current line

You can highlight multiple lines and use TAB and ⇧ + TAB to tab/untab all highlighted lines.




## Commenting
Comment out lines and blocks of code
– – – – – – – – –
⌘ + / = Comment/un-comment current line or highlighted lines
⌘ + ⌥ + / = Block comment/unblock comment highlighted text
 
Alternatively, type:
// to comment out rest of line
/* */ to block comment all text between /* and */

Note that comments are only useful in non-text files (.js, .html, etc.).
Line Manipulation
Select and move lines around
– – – – – – – – –
⌘ + L = Select current line, hold ⌘ and hit L more times to select more lines
⌘ + ⇧ + D = Duplicate whichever line the cursor is on

⌃ + ⌘ + ↑ = move current line up
⌃ + ⌘ + ↓ = move current line down

⌘ + ↵ = Insert a line before current line, moves cursor to new line
⌘ + ⇧ + ↵ = Insert a line after current line, moves cursor to new line




## Find/Replace Text
Find and replace one or all instances of a specific word/string/character

⌘ + F = Find text in file
⌘ + ⌥  + F = Find and replace text in file

⌘ + click = add multiple cursors

Hold down ⌘ and click somewhere else on the screen to add a second cursor. Do this as many times as you’d like to add multiple cursors. This allows you to type/delete text in multiple places at the same time. 

⌘ + D = Highlight word the cursor is on, find all instances of word in document
    
Press ⌘ + D again to highlight next instance of word, do this as many times as you’d like to highlight multiple instances. Now you can edit these instances simultaneously. 

Press ⌘ + K to skip an instance of the word.

⌘ + ⌃ + G = Highlight all instances of word the cursor is on, edit all instances simultaneously.

⌘ + ⌥ + G = Show all instances of word the cursor is on.
